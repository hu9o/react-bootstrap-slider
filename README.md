# React Bootstrap Slider

This is port of Bootstrap Slider to a React component. This is just a demo but will soon be a self contained component.

## Setup Guide

`git clone git@github.com:jarsbe/react-bootstrap-slider.git`

`cd app`

`npm install`

`npm install webpack -g`

`webpack -w`

Webpack is now watching your project for changes. Open up a new terminal tab to boot up a server.

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and you should be good to go!
